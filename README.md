### Hello World!

<!--[![trophy](https://github-profile-trophy.vercel.app/?username=niladridutt)](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy)-->

  
##### About me 
I am a Research Engineer at Ready Player Me working on Generative AI x 3D. I completed my masterâ€™s in Computer Vision at University College London (UCL) advised by Prof. Niloy Mitra. Previously, I was a Founding Engineer at NFTPort leading machine learning from its inception through its Series A round of $26M.

I am interested in generating and editing 3D content (particularly meshes that are compatible with graphics engines) using text instructions, images or other simple modalities.

##### Ex research - UCL, Nvidia, CITRIS Policy Lab @ UC Berkeley, IIT Kharagpur
